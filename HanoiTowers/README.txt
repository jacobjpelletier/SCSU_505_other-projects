This is an assignment from CSC 505 - Computer Programming and Data Structures. 

HOMEWORK 6 - Towers of Hanoi:

“Have fun playing the game Towers of Hanoi.  I think this page has a decent implementation. http://haubergs.com/hanoi
Now, you get to have fun making two versions of a solver for the game.  (No cheating; this means searching for the answer).
Requirements
	1.	One version should use iteration (loops)
	2.	The other version should use recursion (functions). 
	3.	Be as creative as you want with your disc designs (the bigger discs just need to be bigger than the smaller discs). 
	4.	The game should have 3 towers.  
	5.	The user should be able to enter a number of discs. 
	6.	The input should be validated.
	7.	The discs should be move one at a time like the rules of the game state. 
	8.	There should be a 3 to 5 second pause between moves.  (We aren't testing someone's iconic memory here)
	9.	The discs should start on the left most tower and move to the right most tower.
Submit the two files two the same repository on GitHub.”
