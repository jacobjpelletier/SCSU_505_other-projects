This is an assignment from CSC 505 - Computer Programming and Data Structures. 

HOMEWORK 7 - PALINDROME CHECKER:

"Create a palindrome checker function.  The function should check for palindromes in strings or lists.  I've decided to let you decide how you want to handle whitespace and nested lists (this is a chance to practice recursion).  Just provide documentation (comments) in code on your decision.  The function should output to the console the string/list tested and whether it is a palindrome."
